<a href="http://soapadoo.com/up"></a>Last month I discovered <a href="http://spanningsync.com/">Spanning Sync</a>, and the good life has gotten better.  Spanning Sync accomplishes what basic iCal subscirbe and publish features can't give you.  It performs a bi-directional sync between your google calendars and your iCal calendars.  What that means is that you can make changes to iCal or google calendar and they are automatically available in both.  I can create an event in iCal and view and edit it on google.

The one downside so far is that it doesn't sync todo lists, but it is still in beta and I am sure more cool features are on the way.
