The title will get a handful of you laughing who know exactly the circumstance to which I am referring.  For everyone else just know that it means bad things happening with your mac laptop.

Speaking of bad things happening with mac laptops, I recently tried to apply the latest software updates from apple, and it didn't go so smoothly.  To start with the update didn't apply and then when I rebooted OS X wouldn't finish initializing.  I booted off the install CD and used disk utility to repair my drive, but to no avail.  DiskUtility fixed a permissions issue, but could not repair the disk.  It got stuck on "incorrect node structure" or some such.  Apparently <a href="http://www.alsoft.com/DiskWarrior/">DiskWarrior</a> comes highly recommended for fixing these types of issues, but I didn't have $100 bucks to shell out to fix my problem.  However, I was able to boot my laptop into target disk mode and pull everything off onto another computer, before reinstalling and restoring. YUCK!

It seems like there must be a better way to recover from catastrophic failures.  I could force myself to create a complete bootable backup before installing anymore updates.  This is what I probably will do in the short term even though it is rather time consuming.  
The other option is to somehow move all the important stuff onto the network, like <a href="http://coderhythm.com/">Chris</a> was talking about the other day, with remote home directories.  

In general I want to decrease the time for recovery.  I think this will probably involve a combination of technologies and will be definitely be one of my pet projects from now on.  Maybe I will even get it down to a single <a href="http://manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/book/17">capistrano</a> command ;)
