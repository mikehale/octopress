I have discovered through trial and error that the best format for resumes is either plain text or word.  I highly recommend keeping your resume in plain text for a few reasons.

<ol>
	<li>Everyone can read plain text.</li>

	<li>Lots of job sites require you to paste your plain text resume into a form.</li>

	<li>Most importantly it keeps you focused on the content instead of the formatting.  This reminds me of the discssion between <a href="http://linuxgazette.net/issue22/words.html"> word processing, vs. text processing</a>. </li>
	<li>If someone does want to see your resume in word it is easy enough to paste your plain text into OpenOffice and "save as word".</li>
</ol>
