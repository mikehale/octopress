title: "Planning out the ultimate home entertainment system"

I've been thinking a lot lately about what the ultimate home entertainment setup would be... at least according to my definition of ultimate. That includes at least a [40 inch LED Samsung](http://www.samsung.com/us/consumer/tv-video/televisions/led-tv/UN40B6000VFUZA/index.idx?pagetype=prd_detail&returnurl=) hung on the wall and only power and HDMI cables to the display. Also in the wall and ceiling 5.1 [speakers](http://www.crutchfield.com/g_12600/In-wall-Speakers.html?tp=192).

As for content I want access to CD/DVD/BlueRay, hulu, personal video, music, pictures and broadcast TV. I'm planning to use boxee as the heart of the system for accessing online content, and I will probably end up writing a MythTV boxee app to get access to DVR capability for live tv from an [HDHomeRun](http://www.silicondust.com/products/hdhomerun_home_atsc). I also want to be able to easily switch the video from boxee to my Wii.

That last bit is what I'm still puzzling over how to implement. My current thinking is to either use a receiver along with an RF to IR [bridge](http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/remotes/universal_remotes/devices/6347&cl=us,en). Or to grab the audio and video directly from the Wii with the [HDPRV](http://www.hauppauge.com/site/products/data_hdpvr.html) and somehow display it in boxee.

The advantage of using a remote controlled receiver is that I would have a dedicated device for handling HD content, which should ensure there are no video lag or stutter issues. The advantage of displaying through boxee is that boxee is the one interface to manage everything which is kinda cool.

To support all of this content I'm planning to build a 3-4TB RAIDZ1 OpenSolaris storage server. That should give me plenty of initial capacity and the enclosure will allow for up to 8 drives total.
