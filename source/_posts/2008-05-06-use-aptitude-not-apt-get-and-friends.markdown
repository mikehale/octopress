[From Aaron Toponce's blog](http://pthree.org/2007/08/12/aptitude-vs-apt-get/)
>Aptitude is just superior to apt-get in every way, shape, and form. Better dependency handling. Better curses application. Better options. ONE tool. Better stdout formatting. The list goes on and on. I see constantly, on forums, IRC and email, the use of apt-get. We need to better educate our brethren and sisters about the proper use of tools, and show them the enlightened way of aptitude. I've been using aptitude since I first learned about it, a[n]d will continue to do so the remainder of my Debian/Ubuntu days.
