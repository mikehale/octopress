I have been using capistrano lately to deploy a ruby application.  After completing my task and struggling through lack luster documentation from what I thought was the <a href="http://manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/book/17">definitive source</a>.  I stumbled across a much easier to understand and more recent site: <b><a href="http://capify.org/">http://capify.org/</a></b>
