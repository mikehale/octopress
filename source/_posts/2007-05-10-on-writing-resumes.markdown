title: On Writing Resumes
---
I have discovered through trial and error that the best format for resumes is either plain text or word. I highly recommend keeping your resume in plain text for a few reasons.

* Everyone can read plain text.
* Lots of job sites require you to paste your plain text resume into a form.
* Most importantly it keeps you focused on the content instead of the formatting. This reminds me of the discssion between [word processing, vs. text processing](http://linuxgazette.net/issue22/words.html).
* If someone does want to see your resume in word it is easy enough to paste your plain text into OpenOffice and "save as word".
