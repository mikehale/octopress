title: What I learned at Ruby Hoedown
categories: [rubyhoedown, conferences]

At the end of the [conference](http://rubyhoedown.com), [Nathaniel](http://blog.talbott.ws/) asked for 5 volunteers to share something they learned. I was not one of those volunteers. However I am thankful to report that I did learn something ;)  Actually I learned quite a few things, but the one that I feel is most important is that good software is all about good people. Crossing the chasm, is not about a particular language, it goes beyond any single language. It is about writing beautiful code, and training up and inspiring the next generation to do the same.
