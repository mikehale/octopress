At the end of the <a href="http://rubyhoedown.com">conference</a>, <a href="http://blog.talbott.ws/">Nathaniel</a> asked for 5 volunteers to share something they learned.  I was not one of those volunteers.  However I am thankful to report that I did learn something ;)  Actually I learned quite a few things, but the one that I feel is most important is that good software is all about good people.  Crossing the chasm, is not about a particular language, it goes beyond any single language.  It is about writing beautiful code, and training up and inspiring the next generation to do the same.
