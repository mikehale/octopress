By universal I don't mean universal binary, though adium is shipped as one.  I mean that it can connect to all the networks (aim, msn, yahoo, jabber, google talk, bonjour, etc).  Hasn't adium dones this for a while?  Yes it has, but when I tried it about 2 years ago it just felt clunky and unusable compared to iChat. Now it has definitely surpassed iChat in terms of usability and features.  I can even get rid of the annoying duck sounds so that it looks and sounds like iChat, only I can now chat with all the networks. Biggest plus: seamlessly integrates with address book. Biggest drawback: it doesn't handle audio video chats. You still need iChat for that.
