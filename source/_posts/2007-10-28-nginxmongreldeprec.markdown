I have heard lots of good things about [nginx](http://nginx.net/) from various people whom I respect. [Ezra Zygmuntowicz](http://brainspl.at/) and [Jared Richardson](http://www.jaredrichardson.net/) to name two.

I followed [Ezra's blog entry](http://brainspl.at/articles/2006/08/23/nginx-my-new-favorite-front-end-for-mongrel-cluster) about nginx and added a few enhancments of my own to create a capistrano recipe and template that works for me and might be a good starting point for your own nginx experience. Enjoy!
