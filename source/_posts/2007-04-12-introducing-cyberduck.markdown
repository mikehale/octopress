title: Introducing Cyberduck
---
[Cyberduck](http://cyberduck.ch/) is solid and useful opensource SFTP/FTP program for the mac.  I have used it for the past couple of days to update a handful of websites.  BTW you know it has to be great when it integrates with [TextMate](http://macromates.com/), [Growl](http://growl.info/), and [Quicksilver](http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/) ;)

I also used [RCDefaultApp](http://www.rubicode.com/Software/RCDefaultApp) to make Cyberduck the default FTP client on my mac, replacing the hideous finder FTP client.
