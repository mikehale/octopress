title: Time Management for System Administrators (uber quick review)
---
So I finally finished reading the book that would solve all of my problems, "Time Management for System Administrators".  Actually it doesn't promise to do that.  In fact it promises only to provide a framework, (that works for the author, and could be adapted to you), for managing time.

In the first chapter Thomas deals with handling interruptions to make sure that you are able to finish the book.  Sadly I did not  consistently follow his suggestions about setting up an interruption shield, which is why it took me over 3 months to read 200 pages ;)  

The title suggests that the book is for system administrators, but I can see how many of the techniques could be useful in other disciplines.  For instance some of the suggestions I had already implemented in school, or as a software developer.  However, it was very helpful to see them literally spelled out and to read a more thoughtful perspective than my own.  

Here is the chapter list to give you an idea of the topics covered:

* Time Management Principles
* Focus Versus Interruptions
* Routines
* The Cycle System
* The Cycle System: To Do Lists and Schedules
* The Cycle System: Calendar Management
* The Cycle System: Life Goals
* Prioritization
* Stress Management
* Email Management
* Eliminating Time Wasters (don't read blogs, ouch! ;) )
* Documentation
* Automation

Make sure to read the Forward, Preface, and Epilogue.  I usually skip those sections, but Thomas manages to make them useful and entertaining, like the rest of the book.

At the end of the book Thomas recommends David Allen's ["Getting Things Done"](http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280) as a general time management book.
