title: Automate mysql backups
---
A few weeks ago I came across a great little tool named mysql-zrm for backing up one or more remote mysql databases.  It makes taking snapshots of one or more mysql databases a cinch.  Here are some of the features listed on [the homepage](http://www.zmanda.com/backup-mysql.html).

* Schedule full and incremental backups of your MySQL database.
* Backup your remote MySQL database through a firewall.
* Configure on-the-fly compression and/or encryption of your MySQL backups to meet your storage and security needs.
* Get e-mail notification about the status of your backups and receive MySQL backup reports via RSS feed.
* Monitor and browse your backups.
* Define retention policies and delete backups that have expired.
* Recover a database easily to any point in time or to any particular transaction, e.g. just before a user made an error.

For a quick and easy way to get started I found [this tutorial](http://www.zmanda.com/quick-mysql-backup.html) very helpful.
