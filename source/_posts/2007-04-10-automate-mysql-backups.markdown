A few weeks ago I came across a great little tool named mysql-zrm for backing up one or more remote mysql databases.  It makes taking snapshots of one or more mysql databases a cinch.  Here are some of the features listed on <a href="http://www.zmanda.com/backup-mysql.html">the homepage.</a>
<ul>
	<li>Schedule full and incremental backups of your MySQL database.</li>

	<li>Backup your remote MySQL database through a firewall.</li>

	<li>Configure on-the-fly compression and/or encryption of your MySQL backups to meet your storage and security needs.</li>

	<li>Get e-mail notification about the status of your backups and receive MySQL backup reports via RSS feed.</li>

	<li>Monitor and browse your backups.</li>

	<li>Define retention policies and delete backups that have expired.</li>

	<li>Recover a database easily to any point in time or to any particular transaction, e.g. just before a user made an error.</li>
</ul>

For a quick and easy way to get started I found <a href="http://www.zmanda.com/quick-mysql-backup.html">this tutorial</a> very helpful.
