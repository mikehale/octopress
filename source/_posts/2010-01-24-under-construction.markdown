title: "Under Construction"

I probably don't have many readers to this blog, but for the faithful few you will notice that the theme has changed. This is entirely thanks to the excellent [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) blog theme and software. Octopress was created by [Brandon Mathis](http://brandonmathis.com/) and is based on the programmer friendly [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) blog tool. Thanks to Octopress and Jekyll I can have a nice looking blog and use my text editor and [git](http://git-scm.com/) to maintain it.

Also I'm working on converting the content over from my old wordpress blog. The old posts will be available in the near future. I'm also hoping to import comments into disqus.
