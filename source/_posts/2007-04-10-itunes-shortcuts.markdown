If you are a keyboard junkie like me and also enjoying listening to music in iTunes then the following keyboard shortcut should come in handy:

From anywhere in iTunes hit `Command-Option-F` to search the currently selected source. You can then play the list by hitting `tab, space`.

For those windows users out there `Command-Option-F` translates to `Control+Alt+F`.

Thanks to [this lifehacker post](http://lifehacker.com/software/itunes/add-search-keyboard-shortcut-to-itunes-on-your-mac-246006.php) for this info.
